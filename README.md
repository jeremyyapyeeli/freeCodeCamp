# freeCodeCamp Solutions
This repo houses the solutions that I have worked on with the help of StackOverflow and other sources in order to obtain my certifications.

Feel free to browse through the solutions, but I would highly encourage you to only use them as a reference and most importantly, understand why each of the lines are written in that manner.

# Certifications Obtained

### [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python) (1st April 2023)
Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.
